# Introduction
I followed all the requirements as provided. I used SASS to write the CSS and compiled it down to CSS. One note that I would like to make is the font size style I applied to the HTML tag. The technique I used modifies the base font-size on the html using a percentage. This adjusts things so that 1rem equals 10px, instead of the default 16px. To set the font-size to the equivalent of 14px, set it to 1.4em. Which allows me to keep the site more responsive and the math is easy to compute as you go along with the disgn.

# Requirements
1. "Open Sans" from Google Fonts - regular and bold -- done

2. approximately 1100px wide wrapper or container (this doesn't absolutely need to be 1100px, maybe you want to work with percentages, a grid, fluid units, etc!) Have fun with it!

3. a full bleed background colour (#d5d5d5).

4. an overlay on hover of images (hint: try using a "to bottom right" linear gradient and percentages to get the triangle look!)

5. font awesome icons in the footer, make sure these are links. They should also have a hover state, it could be a colour change or something else, or a combination. Feel free to actually link them to a real destination, such as Toronto's official accounts unless you are customizing yours.
